# R8A2 Password Generator

A little wbesite that generates the Rundown 8 A2 secret terminal password for any week.  

This was actually quite a pain to get working just because JS numbers are just 'numbers';  
Getting integer overflow to work properly, like how it's abused by the hashing algorithm used in GTFO, was quite the journey.
